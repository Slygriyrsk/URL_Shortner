You can customize the `shortUrl` model and `server.js` for different settings or features. The default configuration uses `localhost:27017/urlShortener` for MongoDB. You can change this in `server.js`:

    
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/urlShortener', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
    });
